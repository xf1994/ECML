#ECML: An Ensemble Cascade Metric Learning Mechanism towards Face Verification

## Introduction
This is the code for the paper, **"ECML: An Ensemble Cascade Metric Learning Mechanism towards Face Verification"**. 

In this paper, we propose a novel metric learning mechanism towards Face Verification called ECML. In particular, hierarchical metric learning is executed in the cascade way to alleviate underfitting. Meanwhile, at each learning level, the features are split into non-overlapping groups. Then, metric learning is executed among the feature groups in the ensemble manner to resist overfitting.
